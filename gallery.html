            <pre> Linus Torvalds, (born December 28, 1969, Helsinki, Finland), Finnish computer scientist who was the principal force behind the development of the Linux operating
             system.  At age 10 Torvalds began to dabble in computer programming on his grandfather’s Commodore VIC-20. In 1991, while a computer science student at the University 
                of Helsinki(M.S., 1996), he purchased his first personal computer (PC). He was not satisfied, however, with the computer’s operating system (OS).
                His PC used MS-DOS (the disk operating system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds preferred the UNIX operating system he had used on the university’s computers. 
                He decided to create his own PC-based version of UNIX. Months of determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an operating system known as Linux.
                In 1991 he posted a message on the Internet to alert other PC users to his new system, made the software available for free downloading, and, as was a common practice
                among softwaedevelopers at the time, he released the source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes. Because of their access to the source code, many programmers helped Torvalds retool and refine the software, and by 1994 Linux kernel (original code) 
                version 1.0 was released.
